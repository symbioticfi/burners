## Burner Router

[See the code here](../src/contracts/router/)

The Burner Router allows redirecting the slashed collateral tokens to different addresses, which may be represented by Burners, Treasury contracts, LP lockers, etc.

### Full Flow

1. Setup

   - Before the Vault's creation, deploy a new Burner Router via `BurnerRouterFactory` with the same collateral address as the Vault will use
   - Deploy the Vault inputting the received `BurnerRouter` address and `IBaseSlasher.BaseParams.isBurnerHook` set to `true`

2. Update setup

   - Change global receiver, network-specific receivers, operator-network-specific receivers with the configured delay (in case of pending set requests, they are overrided with the new ones)
   - Change `delay` itself after the delay (in case of pending set requests, they are overrided with the new ones)

3. Slashing

   - The router is called via `onSlash()` function
   - It determines the needed address for redirection and saves the redirection amount for it

4. Trigger transfer

   - Transfers a given account's whole balance from the router to this account
